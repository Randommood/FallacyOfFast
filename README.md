# The Fallacy Of Fast

Accompanying repository for "The Fallacy of Fast". Feel free to open any issues for questions and/or to say hi :)

### Abstract
We all want to move fast. We construct our systems in a rapidly-iterating and agile way. Ideally we design and build them to be efficient, robust, and have low latency. But sometimes in the search for speed we make mistakes that come back to haunt us.

The talk is about the things most of us sacrifice when trying to iterate fast. Some of these are reasonable trade-offs â€” others can wreck your product. I hope you will walk away with a notion of what to pay attention to at various stages of software development, and how you can avoid common pitfalls.
